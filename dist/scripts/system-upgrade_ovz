## recreate commit, is this part atomic?
## ostree refs --delete trunk
## ostree refs --create trunk $cmt
## - if the delta application is interrupted ostree itself should deal with it so
## it is not a problem of the update process
## - if the update process is interrupted while manipulating revisions it is not
## a problem because delete->create is dumb and will always go through on sequent
## runs.
## - ostree admin upgrade is supposed to be atomic, we run it before recreating
## the ref in case it was interrupted,

## sanity check
